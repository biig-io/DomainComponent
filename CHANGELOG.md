## [1.3.0] - 2018-03-14
### Added

- New method `instantiateWithArguments` on the instantiator (because most part of the time you want to add arguments)
- The deserializer is now only one class: simpler and better. It decorates the serializer the right way.

### Changed

- DEPRECATED: as a result of refactoring the deserializer the `ApiPlatformDomainDeserializer` is deprecated
    to be removed in the 2.x version.

## [1.2.0] - 2018-02-28
### Added

- The domain event dispatcher now supports "delayed" rules that will be execute only after the model is persist.
- Automatic persist detection for doctrine with the new doctrine subscriber `DoctrinePostPersistListener`
- Integration of the doctrine subscriber in the bundle
- The component now uses an interface and a trait to avoid to force you to extends from a specific class

### Changed

- [Minor BC Break] The DomainEventDispatcher now accept a `RuleInterface` instead of `DomainRuleInterface`.
  This is a problem only if you extends the domain dispatcher (which is to do only in very special cases).
